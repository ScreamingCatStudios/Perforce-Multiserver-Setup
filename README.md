# Perforce-Multiserver-Setup
This script makes it simple to setup multiple perforce server instances to work with many small teams of people to allow those small teams to still use the "free" tier from perforce. This should be used within the bounds of perforce's own terms and conditions and should not be used to bypass those terms.
